Then, we calculate the coefficients `theta` using the normal equation formula: `(X^T * X)^-1 * X^T * y`. Finally, we return the coefficients `theta` as the output of the function.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mCertainly! Let's break down the provided Python function for linear regression step by step, understanding each component in detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes how the dependent variable changes as the independent variables change.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, we implement linear regression using the **Normal Equation**, which provides a method for directly calculating the coefficients of the regression line based on the provided data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Breakdown\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import numpy as np\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- The code begins by importing the NumPy library (imported as `np`), which is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Defining the `linear_regression` Function\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def linear_regression(X, y):\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- Here we define a function named `linear_regression` that takes two parameters:\n",
      "  - `X`: A 2D numpy array or matrix where each row represents a data point (observation) and each column represents a feature (independent variable).\n",
      "  - `y`: A 1D numpy array or vector containing the target or dependent variable values corresponding to each observation in `X`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Adding an Intercept Term\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "X = np.hstack((np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- To account for the intercept in the linear equation (which represents the value of `y` when all predictors are zero), we need to add a column of ones to the left of the features matrix `X`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - `X.shape[0]` returns the number of rows in `X`, which is the number of observations.\n",
      "  - `np.ones((X.shape[0], 1))` creates a column vector of ones with the same number of rows as `X`.\n",
      "  - `np.hstack(...)` horizontally stacks the column of ones and the original `X` to create an augmented matrix. The modified version of `X` now includes a column of ones as its first column.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Calculating the Coefficients Using the Normal Equation\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "theta = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- This line uses the **Normal Equation** to compute the optimal parameters (coefficients) for the linear regression.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - **Normal Equation Formula**: \\[ \\Theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty \\]\n",
      "    - `X.T.dot(X)` computes the dot product of the transpose of X (`X^T`) with X, yielding a square matrix.\n",
      "    - `np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X))` takes the inverse of the calculated matrix. This step can only be performed if `(X^TX)` is invertible.\n",
      "    - `X.T.dot(y)` computes the product of the transpose of X and the target vector y.\n",
      "    - The overall dot product calculates the coefficients `theta`. This vector contains the weight for each feature, including the intercept term.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Returning the Coefficients\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "return theta\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "Certainly! Let's break down the provided Python function for linear regression step by step, understanding each component in detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes how the dependent variable changes as the independent variables change.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, we implement linear regression using the **Normal Equation**, which provides a method for directly calculating the coefficients of the regression line based on the provided data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Breakdown\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import numpy as np\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- The code begins by importing the NumPy library (imported as `np`), which is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Defining the `linear_regression` Function\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def linear_regression(X, y):\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- Here we define a function named `linear_regression` that takes two parameters:\n",
      "  - `X`: A 2D numpy array or matrix where each row represents a data point (observation) and each column represents a feature (independent variable).\n",
      "  - `y`: A 1D numpy array or vector containing the target or dependent variable values corresponding to each observation in `X`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Adding an Intercept Term\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "X = np.hstack((np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- To account for the intercept in the linear equation (which represents the value of `y` when all predictors are zero), we need to add a column of ones to the left of the features matrix `X`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - `X.shape[0]` returns the number of rows in `X`, which is the number of observations.\n",
      "  - `np.ones((X.shape[0], 1))` creates a column vector of ones with the same number of rows as `X`.\n",
      "  - `np.hstack(...)` horizontally stacks the column of ones and the original `X` to create an augmented matrix. The modified version of `X` now includes a column of ones as its first column.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Calculating the Coefficients Using the Normal Equation\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "theta = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- This line uses the **Normal Equation** to compute the optimal parameters (coefficients) for the linear regression.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - **Normal Equation Formula**: \\[ \\Theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty \\]\n",
      "    - `X.T.dot(X)` computes the dot product of the transpose of X (`X^T`) with X, yielding a square matrix.\n",
      "    - `np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X))` takes the inverse of the calculated matrix. This step can only be performed if `(X^TX)` is invertible.\n",
      "    - `X.T.dot(y)` computes the product of the transpose of X and the target vector y.\n",
      "    - The overall dot product calculates the coefficients `theta`. This vector contains the weight for each feature, including the intercept term.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Returning the Coefficients\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "return theta\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- Finally, the function returns the computed coefficients `theta`, which represents the linear regression model defined by the input features and target variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example usage\n",
      "X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]])\n",
      "y = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
      "\n",
      "theta = linear_regression(X, y)\n",
      "print(theta)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- The example creates a simple dataset:\n",
      "  - `X` is a 2D array with four data points, each having two features.\n",
